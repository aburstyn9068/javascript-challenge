The list can be reset by leaving the date field empty and running the search, or by refreshing the page.

The second version (UFO-level-2) can be updated to filter the data by specifiying any combination of a date, city, state, country, or shape and clicking the "Filter Table" button. The list can be reset by leaving the data fields empty and clicking the "Filter Table" button, or by refreshing the page.
